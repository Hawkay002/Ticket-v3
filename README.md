📖 Overview

This is a serverless, single-file web application designed for exclusive events. It replaces clunky spreadsheets with a sleek, dark-themed dashboard that runs in any browser.
Why this stands out:
 * ✨ Premium Aesthetics: "Midnight Void" dark theme with glassmorphism panels and the modern 'Outfit' typeface.
 * ⚡ Real-Time Sync: Data updates instantly across the check-in desk and security scanners using Firebase Firestore.
 * 🔒 Admin-Only Security: Public registration is disabled. Only specific authorized emails can access the dashboard.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
 * A Google/Firebase Account.
 * A GitHub Account (for hosting).
   
 * Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Hawkay002/Ticket-backend.git
cd Ticket-backend
```
   * Step 2: Firebase Configuration
     * Go to Firebase Console.
     * Create a project and register a Web App (</>).
     * Database: Create a Firestore Database in "Test Mode".
     * Auth: Enable Email/Password authentication.
     * Users: Manually add your admin email/password in the Firebase Console (Users tab).
       * Note: The app code has public registration disabled for security.
* Step 3: Link the Code
Open index.html and find the configuration section. Replace it with your keys:
```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  // ... other keys
};
```
   * Step 4: Add Custom Sounds (Optional)
To enable premium audio feedback, add these two files to your root folder (next to index.html):
     * success.mp3 – Plays on valid entry.
     * error.mp3 – Plays on invalid/duplicate entry.
(If these files are missing, the system will automatically fall back to generated electronic beeps).
